# chain-id
Script for writing chain IDs into PDB files. 
It works by writing in column 22 of each ATOM line a chain ID. 
To do so, it needs the number of different chains and the number of atoms in each chain. 
It is too specific for the system that I wrote it for. In a future, I would want to write it in a more general way, with inputs as the chains and atom numbers. 
Feel free to get in touch or improve it
